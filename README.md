### ðŸŸ¦ `TypeScript`

To run and test the `TypeScript` code, I'm using `Deno` instead of `Node` as the runtime environment, so that I can run the `.ts` files directly without the need of transpiling them to `.js` files:

```bash
deno run <file_name>.ts
```

Similarly, to run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
deno test <file_name>.ts
```
