## Problem B

### Arithmetic progression

The formula to get the last element of a sequence starting from `a` with `d` difference and `n` elements is:

```
a + (n - 1) * d
```

The formula to get the sum of all elements from `a` to `b` with `d` difference is:

```
n * (a + b) / 2
```

## Problem C

### `Deque`

The `deque` is a double-ended queue, which can be used to add, access and remove elements from both ends
